The project consists in the implementation of a website that can help musicians develop their ability to recognize intervals and chords types.
The project is realized in vanilla javascript, css and html.
The site is divided in three main sections: a virtual piano keyboard, an intervals quiz section and a chords quiz section. The virtual piano section is always visible and can not be removed while the design of the site allows to easly navigate through the two quiz sections.
The piano section mimics the layout of a real 61 keys keyboard: an audio file is associated to every key, the 61 mp3 files that contains the different notes, with the timbre of a piano, are stored in a directory called "PianoNotes" and their name indicates the octave and the semitones associated to the note starting from the last C note.
